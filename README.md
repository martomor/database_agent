      - Once pyenv is installed, run the following command to install Python 3.11.9:
         ```
         pyenv install 3.11.9
         ```
      - Set Python 3.11.9 as the global version by running:
         ```
         pyenv global 3.11.9
         ```

    - Using conda:
      - Install conda by following the instructions [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).
      - Create a new conda environment with Python 3.11.9 by running:
         ```
         conda create -n dbagent python=3.11.9
         ```
      - Activate the environment by running:
         ```
