## L2_Interacting_with_a_CSV_Data

This notebook explores the concept of csv agents. By loading tabular data from a csv file, we perfom natural lengaguage queries using OpenAI endpoints to quickly extract information.

## L3_Connecting_to_a_SQL_Database

This notebook demonstrates how to use LangChain to deploy agents capable of querying data from an SQLite instance. The agent will be able to translate natural language into SQL.
