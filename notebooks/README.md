## L2_Interacting_with_a_CSV_Data

This notebook explores the concept of csv agents. By loading tabular data from a csv file, we perfom natural lengaguage queries using OpenAI endpoints to quickly extract information. 

You can find the notebook [here](/notebooks/L2_Interacting_with_a_CSV_Data.ipynb).

## L3_Connecting_to_a_SQL_Database

This notebook demonstrates how to use LangChain to deploy agents capable of querying data from an SQLite instance. The agent will be able to translate natural language into SQL.

## L4_Azure_OpenAI_Function_Calling_Feature

This notebook demonstrate how to use function calling to levarge build in tools (functions) for specific tasks that we want to accomplish. Adding a layer of determinstic behaviour allowing us to control the flow of the agent execution.
